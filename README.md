Still working on ...

This is just a beginner's sandbox. I configured the movement to work with W and D (instead of the arrows), and there are animations for 
being Idle, Jumping, Running, and even for when you're idle but in the air!

Learning the basics of Godot using the animated sprites, 2D collision figure, character templates, physics, animation and buttons!
I made the art using GIMP and want to continue pushing my progress to make a mini-game, maybe a platformer - but really I just
want to continue practicing and creating cool features that might not be typical.

Let's see if I enjoy coding games the wrong way!!

thanks for stopping by :P
