Still working on ...

Learning the basics of Godot using the animated sprites, 2D collision figure, character templates, physics, animation and buttons!
I made the art using GIMP and want to continue pushing my progress to make a mini-game, maybe a platformer - but really I just
want to continue practicing and creating cool features that might not be typical.

Let's see if I enjoy coding games the wrong way!!

thanks for stopping by :P
